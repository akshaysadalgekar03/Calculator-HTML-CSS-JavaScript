# JavaScript concepts used
- Object-oriented programming: The calculator is implemented as a class (Calculator) with constructor, methods, and properties.
- Constructors: The constructor method is used to initialize the calculator object and set its initial state.
- Event handling: Event listeners are added to the number buttons, operation buttons, equals button, and clear button to respond to user interactions.
- DOM manipulation: The querySelector and querySelectorAll methods are used to select elements from the DOM and update their content using innerText.
- Conditional statements: Conditional statements such as if and switch are used to handle different scenarios and perform different actions based on conditions.

The calculator project provides a user-friendly interface for performing arithmetic calculations quickly and efficiently. It showcases the use of HTML for structuring the calculator layout, CSS for styling and visual enhancements, and JavaScript for handling the calculations and displaying the results.
